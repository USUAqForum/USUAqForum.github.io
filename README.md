<img src="./logo.png" width="300">


## Location: Zooom
## Dates: TBA (some time in Augus 2023)

This is the first event of this kind aiming to bring together quantum researchers from the United States and Ukraine. Quantum technologies play ever increasing role in the moder economy. Establishing collaborations will not only further strength the binational relation, but also lay the ground for Ukraine's revitalization. We hope that this forum will become a recurring event.
